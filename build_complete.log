CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:51 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0167 is not set: The FindBoost module is removed.  Run "cmake
  --help-policy CMP0167" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy command to
  set the policy and suppress this warning.

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
